# 👋 Hi there, I’m Brett Fox

**Founder • Developer • Systems Thinker • AI Innovator**

I'm an Australian-based software engineer and systems architect with a passion for automation, high-performance programming, and meaningful tools that eliminate repetitive work. I run my own dev company and build everything from fast AI pipelines to microcontroller-based hardware integrations.

I believe that knowledge is more than just the language representing it.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- 🧠 **FSS-RAG** — A hybrid CPU/GPU semantic search engine with memory-mapped indexing, deep reranking, and LLM-aware document preparation.  
  - Ingests nearly any file type into a fully indexed, cleaned, and enhanced hybrid retrieval model.
  - By carefully breaking down and structuring the components, the best hardware and learning model are used for the task.
  - Achieved 22ms query performance for advanced deep retrieval and sub-ms for batch retrieval on modest hardware.
  - Document ingestion speed/variability was prioritised with ability to make sub document changes to the model with SIMD allowing live indexing during changes.

- 🎓 **FSS-Mini-RAG** — A lightweight, educational distillation of my production RAG system that bridges the gap between too-simple demos and enterprise complexity.
  - Born from 2 years of RAG system development, designed for beginners who want results and developers who want to understand how RAG really works.
  - Dual-mode interface: fast synthesis for quick answers, deep exploration for learning codebases.
  - Built to be extended - use the AI explore mode to understand and build upon the codebase itself. Fork it and create something cool!
  
- 🧰 **Codebase Analytic Toolkit** — Advanced static analysis and visualisation for multi-language codebases, featuring function graphing, quality metrics, and vibe code hardening.

- 🌐 **LLM API Proxy** — A unified interface for local machine learning models with endpoints for chat, embeddings, reranking, summarisation, and performance/token benchmarks, logs and metrics.

- 🧪 **Embedded Dyno Controller** — Arduino + Raspberry Pi system for real-time torque and RPM testing, using calibrated sensors, EEPROM settings, and PID load control.

## 🌱 I'm currently learning

- State space models and memory-efficient ML architectures
- Utilising smaller models with the power of conventional processing to increase throughput
- Advanced memory layout and instruction-level CPU/GPU optimisation
- SIMD instruction optimisations for small scale vector calculations

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

- Open-source projects that push boundaries in performance, dynamic analysis, or tooling  
- AI-enhanced developer tools (code insights, semantic structuring, live visualisation)  
- High-speed document retrieval systems or RAG engines

---

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with

- Research teams working on semantic tensor spaces, state-space models, or AI component system design  
- Someone who can make solid and reliable front ends and gui's so I can focus on what I enjoy ⚙️🛠️

## 💬 Ask me about

- Cleaning and optimising corporate data for improved LLM retrieval and coherence
- Structuring codebases for analysis and refactoring  
- Python memory optimisations, static analysis, and CPU alignment tricks  
- How I am exploring the combination of my skills/tools to create hardening tools for easy to
  understand and mainainable vibe coding on projects well over 5 million tokens 😉

## ⚡ Fun fact

I can run a complete LLM stack, codebase analyser, AND do my day job in a van… and still have enough bandwidth left to teach my daughter German.
