# 👋 Hi there, I’m Brett Fox

**Founder • Developer • Systems Thinker • AI Innovator**

I'm an Australian-based software engineer and systems architect with a passion for automation, high-performance programming, and meaningful tools that eliminate repetitive work. I run my own dev company and build everything from fast AI pipelines to microcontroller-based hardware integrations.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

- 🧠 **FSS-RAG** — A hybrid CPU/GPU semantic search engine with memory-mapped indexing, deep reranking, and LLM-aware prep.
- 🧠 **FSS-RAG** — Ingests most files into a fully indexed, cleaned and enhanced hybrid retireval model.
- 🧰 **Codebase Analytic Toolkit** — Advanced static analysis and visualisation for multi-language codebases.
- 🌐 **LLM API Proxy** — Custom Ollama-compatible endpoints for chat, embeddings, reranking, summarisation, and metrics.
- 🧪 **Embedded Dyno Controller** — Arduino + Pi system for real-time torque/RPM testing using sensors and PID control.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

- Rust and zero-cost abstraction design  
- State space models and memory-efficient ML architectures
- Utilising smaller models with the power of conventional processing to increase throughput
- Advanced memory layout and instruction-level CPU/GPU optimisation
- SIMD instruction optimisations for small scale vector calculations

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

- Open-source projects that push boundaries in performance, dynamic analysis, or tooling  
- AI-enhanced developer tools (code insights, semantic structuring, live visualisation)  
- High-speed document retrieval systems or RAG engines

---

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with

- Research teams working on semantic tensor spaces, state-space models, or AI component system design  
- Someone who can make solid and reliable front ends and gui's so I can focus on what I enjoy ⚙️🛠️

## ⚡ Fun fact

I can run a complete LLM stack, codebase analyser, AND do my day job in a van… and still have enough bandwidth left to teach my daughter German.
